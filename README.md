📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn trends in a telecommunications company using Python. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

🔍 Dataset Information

The dataset contains customer information, including:

Demographics: Senior Citizen, Gender

Subscription Details: Contract Type, Payment Method, Internet & Phone Services

Tenure and Charges: Monthly & Total Charges, Customer Tenure

Churn Status: Whether a customer left the service

📈 Key Findings

Churn Rate: Overall, 26.54% of customers have churned.

Senior Citizens: Higher churn rate (41.7%) compared to non-seniors (23.6%).

Contract Type: Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn, while long-term contracts have lower churn rates.

Payment Method: Electronic check users have the highest churn.

Tenure Impact: Customers with shorter tenure (< 12 months) have a significantly higher churn rate.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis

Data Visualization: To explore and present insights

📌 Recommendations

Encourage long-term contracts: Provide discounts for annual contracts to reduce churn.
